  - This series of notebooks illustrates my workout routine and dietary habits. <br>
  - The diet notebook pulls the dataset from a SQLite database that I created and update daily. The foods associated used to update the monthly intake dataset are stored in an individual food database that I update as I eat new things that have yet to be recorded. <br>
  - The exercises database details how I enter new exercise data into its respective SQL dataset. <br>
  - The weight details notebook takes various body measurments and stores them in a daily updated dataset. The data is then used to update the body fat % trend plot.
