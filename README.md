    <li>This series of notebooks illustrates my workout routine and dietary habits.</li>
    <li>The diet notebook pulls the dataset from a SQLite database that I created and update daily. The foods associated used to update the monthly intake dataset are stored in an individual food database that I update as I eat new things that have yet to be recorded. <a href="https://github.com/Artuk009/Case-Studies/blob/465dcdce3f8697a7afd0c87b23a3f9f410729750/MyFitnessAndNutrition/diet.ipynb">Click Here</a> </li>
    <li>The exercises database details how I enter new exercise data into its respective SQL dataset. <a href="https://github.com/Artuk009/Case-Studies/blob/465dcdce3f8697a7afd0c87b23a3f9f410729750/MyFitnessAndNutrition/exercises.ipynb">Click Here</a>  </li>
    <li>The weight details notebook takes various body measurments and stores them in a daily updated dataset. The data is then used to update the body fat % trend plot. <a href="https://github.com/Artuk009/Case-Studies/blob/465dcdce3f8697a7afd0c87b23a3f9f410729750/MyFitnessAndNutrition/weight_details.ipynb">Click Here</a>  </li>
