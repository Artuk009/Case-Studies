This series of notebooks illustrates my workout routine and dietary habits.

    <li>The <a href="https://github.com/Artuk009/Case-Studies/blob/a626b2a9328a92e7373cdd6262fa8739ddb31558/MyFitnessAndNutrition/diet.ipynb">diet notebook</a> pulls the dataset from a SQLite database that I created and update daily. The foods associated used to update the monthly intake dataset are stored in an individual food database that I update as I eat new things that have yet to be recorded. In this notebook I utilize SQL, Pandas, and Seaborn for analysis and data viz. </li>
    <li>The <a href="https://github.com/Artuk009/Case-Studies/blob/a626b2a9328a92e7373cdd6262fa8739ddb31558/MyFitnessAndNutrition/exercises.ipynb">exercises notebook</a> details how I enter new exercise data into its respective SQL dataset. (Note: the plotly visualization doesn't display in the notebook on GitHub so a png file is available in the main Fitness and Nutrition folder). In this notebook my tools are Pandas, SQL, and Plotly. </li>
    <li>The <a href="https://github.com/Artuk009/Case-Studies/blob/a626b2a9328a92e7373cdd6262fa8739ddb31558/MyFitnessAndNutrition/weight_details.ipynb">weight details notebook</a> takes various body measurments and stores them in a daily updated dataset. The data is then used to update the body fat % and body weight visualizations. The tools for this one are Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.</li>
    <li>I use this <a href="https://github.com/Artuk009/WorkoutLog">WorkoutLog</a> Android app that I developed to record exercise data at the gym. (Kotlin, SQK, and Android Studio) </li>
